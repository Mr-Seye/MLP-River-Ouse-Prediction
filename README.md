## 📖 Project Description

A multi-layered perceptron (MLP) implementation developed to predict the flow of the **River Ouse** using historical hydrological data. This is a basic supervised learning application where the goal is to estimate future river flows based on training from provided time series data.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Multi-layered perceptron neural network
- Predicts river flow from historical measurements
- Customisable training loop with adjustable learning rate
- Visualisations of prediction accuracy using matplotlib

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

---

## 🛠️ Installation Instructions

1. Download the project files, including:
   - The main Python script (`river_flow_mlp.py`)
   - The dataset files

2. Run the script using:
   ```bash
   python river_flow_mlp.py
   
⚠️ The program is hardcoded for the River Ouse dataset and not currently set up for general user input.

---

## 💡 Customisation

You can modify:

    Learning rate

    Number of training iterations

    Some other training parameters via variable assignments in the script

More advanced configuration requires direct edits to the MLP implementation code.

---

## 📦 Prerequisites

  - Python 3.8 or higher

  - Operating System: Windows (developed) or any OS with Python installed

Required libraries:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```
